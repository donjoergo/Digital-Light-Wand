### Digital Light Wand
Improved version of the Digital Light Wand Script V3.0 by <a href="http://mrossphoto.com/digital-light-wand/">Michael Ross</a> and IsO-Mick.

**Please notice, that I used different pins as in the circuit diagam from Michael Ross!**

**My V4.0 includes the following improvements/features:**

* display is only updated when a key is pressed (better readability!)
* repeat infinite (nice for patterns, image only has to be 1px wide!)
* LCD blacklight is switched off when drawing image
* faster bootup-times due to smaller delays
* code in separate files for more clarity
* some smaller adjustments not worth to be mentioned
